Storage Specification
=====================

hdmf-zarr currently uses the Zarr :zarr-docs:`DirectoryStore <api/storage.html#zarr.storage.DirectoryStore>`,
which uses directories and files on a standard file system to serialize data.

Format Mapping
==============

Here we describe the mapping of HDMF primitives (e.g., Groups, Datasets, Attributes, Links, etc.) used by
the HDMF schema language to Zarr storage primitives. HDMF data modeling primitives were originally designed
with HDF5 in mind. However, Zarr uses very similar primitives, and as such the high-level mapping between
HDMF schema and Zarr storage is overall fairly simple. The main complication is that Zarr does not support
links and references (see `Zarr issue #389 <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues/389>`_)
and as such have to implemented by hdmf-zarr.

.. note::

    Attributes are stored as JSON documents in Zarr (using the DirectoryStore). As such, all attributes
    must be JSON serializable. The :py:class:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO` backend attempts to cast types
    (e.g., numpy arrays) to JSON serializable types as much as possible, but not all possible types may
    be supported.

.. _sec-zarr-storage-attributes-reserved:

Reserved attributes
-------------------

The :py:class:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO` backend defines a set of reserved attribute names defined in
:py:attr:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO.__reserve_attribute`. These reserved attributes are used to implement
functionality (e.g., links and object references, which are not natively supported by Zarr) and may be
added on any Group or Dataset in the file.

    ============================  ======================================================================================
    Reserved Attribute Name       Usage
    ============================  ======================================================================================
    zarr_link                     Attribute used to store links. See :ref:`sec-zarr-storage-links` for details.
    zarr_dtype                    Attribute used to specify the data type of a dataset. This is used to implement the
                                  storage of object references as part of datasets.
                                  See :ref:`sec-zarr-storage-references`
    ============================  ======================================================================================

In addition, the following reserved attributes are added to the root Group of the file only:

    Reserved Attribute Name       Usage
    ============================  ======================================================================================
    .specloc                      Attribute storing the path to the Group where the scheme for the file are
                                  cached. See :py:attr:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.SPEC_LOC_ATTR`
    ============================  ======================================================================================


.. _sec-zarr-storage-links:

Links
-----

Similar to soft links in a file system, a link is an object in a Group that links to another Group or Dataset,
either within the same Zarr file or another external Zarr file. Links and reference are not natively supported by
Zarr but are implemented in :py:class:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO` in an OS independent fashion using the ``zarr_link``
reserved attribute (see :py:attr:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO.__reserve_attribute`) to store a list of dicts serialized
as JSON. Each dict (i.e., element) in the list defines a link, with each dict containing the following keys:

* ``name`` : Name of the link
* ``source`` : Relative path to the root of the Zarr file containing the linked object. For links
  pointing to an object within the same Zarr file, the value of source will be ``"."``. For external
  links that point to object in another Zarr file, the value of source will be the path to
  the other Zarr file relative to the root path of the Zarr file containing the link.
* ``path`` : Path to the linked object within the Zarr file identified by the ``source`` key
* ``object_id``: Object id of the reference object. May be None in case the referenced object
  does not have an assigned object_id (e.g., in the case we reference a dataset with a fixed
  name but without and assigned ``data_type`` (or ``neurodata_type`` in the case of NWB).
* ``source_object_id``: Object id of the source Zarr file indicated by the ``source`` key.
  The ``source`` should always have an ``object_id`` (at least if the ``source`` file is
  a valid HDMF formatted file).

For example:

.. code-block:: json

    "zarr_link": [
        {
            "name": "device",
            "source": ".",
            "path": "/general/devices/array",
            "object_id": "f6685427-3919-4e06-b195-ccb7ab42f0fa",
            "source_object_id": "6224bb89-578a-4839-b31c-83f11009292c"
        }
    ]

    target_type                   Not mapped. The target type is determined by the type of the target of the link
    ============================  ======================================================================================


.. hint::

    In Zarr, attributes are stored in JSON as part of the hidden ``.zattrs`` file in the folder defining
    the Group or Dataset.

.. hint::

    In :py:class:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO`, links are written by the
    :py:meth:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO.__write_link__` function, which also uses the helper functions
    i) :py:meth:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO.__get_ref` to construct py:meth:`~hdmf_zarr.utils.ZarrRefernce`
    and ii) :py:meth:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO.__add_link__` to add a link to the Zarr file.
    :py:meth:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO.__read_links` then parses links and also uses the
    :py:meth:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO.__resolve_ref` helper function to resolve the paths stored in links.


.. _sec-zarr-storage-references:

Object References
-----------------

Object reference behave much the same way as Links, with the key difference that they are stored as part
of datasets or attributes. This approach allows for storage of large collections of references as values
of multi-dimensional arrays (i.e., the data type of the array is a reference type).

Storing object references in Datasets
-------------------------------------

To identify that a dataset contains object reference, the reserved attribute ``zarr_dtype`` is set to
``'object'`` (see also :ref:`sec-zarr-storage-attributes-reserved`). In this way, we can unambiguously
if a dataset stores references that need to be resolved.

Similar to Links, object references are defined via dicts, which are stored as elements of
the Dataset. In contrast to links, individual object reference do not have a ``name`` but are identified
by their location (i.e., index) in the dataset. As such, object references only have the ``source`` with
the relative path to the target Zarr file, and the ``path`` identifying the object within the source
Zarr file. The individual object references are defined in the
:py:class:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO` as py:class:`~hdmf_zarr.utils.ZarrReference` object created via
the :py:meth:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO.__get_ref` helper function.

By default, :py:class:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO` uses the ``numcodecs.pickles.Pickle`` codec to
encode object references defined as py:class:`~hdmf_zarr.utils.ZarrReference` dicts in datasets.
Users may set the codec used to encode objects in Zarr datasets via the ``object_codec_class``
parameter of the :py:func:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO.__init__` constructor of
:py:class:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO`. E.g.,  we could use
``ZarrIO( ... , object_codec_class=numcodecs.JSON)`` to serialize objects using JSON.

Storing object references in Attributes
---------------------------------------

Object references are stored in a attributes as dicts with the following keys:

* ``zarr_dtype`` : Indicating the data type for the attribute. For object references
  ``zarr_dtype`` is set to ``"object"`` (or ``"region"`` for :ref:`sec-zarr-storage-references-region`)
* ``value``: The value of the object references, i.e., here the py:class:`~hdmf_zarr.utils.ZarrReference`
  dictionary with the ``source``, ``path``, ``object_id``, and ``source_object_id`` keys defining
  the object reference, with the definition of the keys being the same as
  for :ref:`sec-zarr-storage-links`.

For example in NWB, the attribute ``ElectricalSeries.electrodes.table`` would be defined as follows:

.. code-block:: json

    "table": {
        "value": {
            "path": "/general/extracellular_ephys/electrodes",
            "source": ".",
            "object_id": "f6685427-3919-4e06-b195-ccb7ab42f0fa",
            "source_object_id": "6224bb89-578a-4839-b31c-83f11009292c"
        },
        "zarr_dtype": "object"
    }

.. _sec-zarr-storage-references-region:

Region references
-----------------

Region references are similar to object references, but instead of references other Datasets or Groups,
region references link to subsets of another Dataset. To identify region references, the reserved attribute
``zarr_dtype`` is set to ``'region'`` (see also :ref:`sec-zarr-storage-attributes-reserved`). In addition
to the ``source`` and ``path``, the  py:class:`~hdmf_zarr.utils.ZarrReference` object will also need to
store the definition of the ``region`` that is being referenced, e.g., a slice or list on point indices.

.. warning::

    Region references are not yet fully implemented in :py:class:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO`.
    To implement region references will require updating:
    1)  py:class:`~hdmf_zarr.utils.ZarrReference` to add a ``region`` key to support storing
    the selection for the region,
    2) :py:meth:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO.__get_ref` to support passing in the region definition to
    be added to the py:class:`~hdmf_zarr.utils.ZarrReference`,
    3) :py:meth:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO.write_dataset` already partially implements the required
    logic for creating region references by checking for :py:class:`hdmf.build.RegionBuilder` inputs
    but will likely need updates as well
    4) :py:meth:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO.__read_dataset` to support reading region references,
    which may also require updates to :py:meth:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO.__parse_ref` and
    :py:meth:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO.__resolve_ref`, and
    5) and possibly other parts of :py:class:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO`.
    6) The py:class:`~hdmf_zarr.zarr_utils.ContainerZarrRegionDataset` and
    py:class:`~hdmf_zarr.zarr_utils.ContainerZarrRegionDataset` classes will also need to be finalized
    to support region references.

.. _sec-zarr-caching-specifications:

Caching format specifications
=============================

In practice it is useful to cache the specification a file was created with (including extensions)
directly in the Zarr file. Caching the specification in the file ensures that users can access
the specification directly if necessary without requiring external resources.
For the Zarr backend, caching of the schema is implemented as follows.

The :py:class:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.ZarrIO`` backend adds the reserved top-level group ``/specifications``
in which all format specifications (including extensions) are cached. The default name for this group is
defined in :py:attr:`~hdmf_zarr.backend.DEFAULT_SPEC_LOC_DIR` and caching of
specifications is implemented in ``ZarrIO.__cache_spec``.
The ``/specifications`` group contains for each specification namespace a subgroup
``/specifications/<namespace-name>/<version>`` in which the specification for a particular version of a namespace
are stored (e.g., ``/specifications/core/2.0.1`` in the case of the NWB core namespace at version 2.0.1).
The actual specification data is then stored as a JSON string in scalar datasets with a binary, variable-length string
data type. The specification of the namespace is stored in
``/specifications/<namespace-name>/<version>/namespace`` while additional source files are stored in
``/specifications/<namespace-name>/<version>/<source-filename>``. Here ``<source-filename>`` refers to the main name
of the source-file without file extension (e.g., the core namespace defines ``nwb.ephys.yaml`` as source which would
be stored in ``/specifications/core/2.0.1/nwb.ecephys``).

Consolidating Metadata
======================

Zarr allows users to consolidate all metadata for groups and arrays within the given store. By default, every file
will consolidate all metadata within into a single `.zmetadata` file, stored in the root group. This reduces the number of read
operations when retrieving certain metadata in read mode.

.. note::

    When updating a file, the consolidated metadata will also need to be updated via
